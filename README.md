# excel-challenge

## Project Description:
Crowdfunding platforms like Kickstarter and Indiegogo have been growing in success and popularity since the late 2000s. From independent content creators to famous celebrities, more and more people are using crowdfunding to launch new products and generate buzz, but not every project has found success.

To receive funding, the project must meet or exceed an initial goal, so many organizations dedicate considerable resources looking through old projects in an attempt to discover “the trick” to finding success. For this week's Challenge, you will organize and analyze a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends.

Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC, and is intended for educational purposes only.
I Used conditional formatting , created pivot tables with pivot chart such as stacked-column, used some fuctions for calculations and conversions. I created a table with data calculated from  the original data and made a line chart related to the data in that table.

### Statistical Analysis:
Most people would use the number of campaign backers to assess the success of a crowdfunding campaign. Creating a summary statistics table is one of the most efficient ways that data scientists can characterize quantitative metrics, such as the number of campaign backers.

For gaining an in-depth understanding of campaign backers, evaluate the number of backers of successful and unsuccessful campaigns by creating your own summary statistics table.
